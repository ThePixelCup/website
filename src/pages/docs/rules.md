## How to complete the sticker album?
96 stickers are required to complete the album. 32 home jerseys, 32 away jerseys and 32 goalkeeper. This means that per country participating in the WC 2022, you need to collect 1 home, 1 away and 1 goalkeeper pixel jersey sticker. The player number is not relevant to complete the album.

## How is the pool prize distributed?
Once a user collects all 96 stickers, they can claim the prize. A prize need to be claimed, it is not airdropped. Every time a user claims a prize, they will receive half of the pool prize at that moment. This will continue until the last possible winner claims the prize and receives the remaining balance.

## What happens to the winner stickers?
The stickers used to claim the cash prize will be burned so they canâ€™t be used again.

# A launchpad for new collections
We are creating an NFT experience that doesnâ€™t stop after minting, something that you can collect, trade and that has value backed by the community. This is our first collection, but we believe that there are many other kinds of collections that can be organized in an album. 

We are setting the grounds so we can later develop new collections or even let other creators build and launch their own albums. 

Sticker holders from The Pixel Cup will be rewarded with airdrops from our new collections and from our future governance token.
If you are interested in participating in this future make you sure to hold on to your stickers. If you want to launch a collection with us [contact us]
